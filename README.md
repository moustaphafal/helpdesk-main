# Helpdesk
Helpdesk software built in Java using Spring Boot

Helpdesk will allow users to open trouble tickets or repair requests directly within a portal, and receive email updates on those tickets as they are assigned, worked, and closed. 

Helpdesk is meant to be used internally, i.e. within a company, so that employees can submit requests to the IT department for issues they might face. This will help with organization, efficiency, and reduce clutter that emailed requests can sometimes create. 

Tracking and statistics will be built in, so that the IT department can see how long specific requests take, on average. Using this information, a supervisor can can ensure every tech assigned tickets is working efficiently to resolve issues.
